            <sup>1</sup>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
            <sup>2</sup>The same was in the beginning with God.
            <sup>3</sup>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
            <sup>4</sup>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
            <sup>5</sup>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
            <sup>6</sup>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
            <sup>7</sup>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
            <sup>8</sup>He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
            <sup>9</sup>That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
            <sup>10</sup>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
            <sup>11</sup>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
            <sup>12</sup>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
